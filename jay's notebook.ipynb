    "based off of this data then it can be concluded that for my individual metric ---- is the best neighborhood.  This is based off of their high walkability score, meaning that people can get around on foot easily without the assistance of a car or public transportation.  This makes it a good neighborhood because it save people money and time by having things close together allowing people to walk, so they dont need to spend their money on transporation.  This also as a result will decrease the amount of pollution in this neighborhood because of low traffic.  These combining factors would make this a very pleasant neighborhood to live in.  It has also been scientifically shown that tight knit communities such as these that allow people to walk freely as they please can make a drastic difference in happiness: \" People who can walk to their favorite cafe, stroll to a neighborhood park, or saunter to a community center are more trusting and civically involved than people who live in car-centric places\" (Watson 1).\n",
