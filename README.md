# The Bosses CMPINF 0010 Final Project

## Abstract

Through the course of working on this project using the data from supermarkets, walkability scores, and community gardes, we were able to conclude that ---- is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh.

### Data Set #1 - Supermarkets



### Data Set #2 - Walkability Scores

This data set provided each neighboorhoods census tract number as well as their walkability score.  The scores range from 0 - 100 with 0 being the worst and 100 the best.  This allowed us to conclude which neighborhoods had very walkable streets and close together ammenities.
