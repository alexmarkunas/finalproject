# The Bosses CMPINF 0010 Final Project

## Abstract

Through the course of working on this project using the data from supermarkets, walkability scores, and food gardens, we were able to conclude that Downtown Pittsburgh (Central Business District) is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh.

### Data Set #1 - Supermarkets

The supermarket data set provides street addresses and the types of supermarkets they contain (ie: Aldi, Giant Eagle Trader Joe's) as well as how many are in the deisgnated location.  This allows us to conclude what neighborhoods have the most supermarkets.

### Data Set #2 - Walkability Scores

This data set provided each neighboorhoods census tract number as well as their walkability score.  The scores range from 0 -100 with 0 being the worst and 100 the best.  This allowed us to conclude which neighborhoods had very walkable streets and close together ammenities.

### Data Set #3 - Food Gardens

The food gardens data set gives links to local food gardens as well as their addresses.  This is beneficial because not only does it tell people where the food gardens are, but what organization is taking care of them.
